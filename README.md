## K-Periodic
(Every group of all K characters should be equal: abcabcabc, heer k = 3)
Given a string s, we've to find the minimum number of swaps required to convert the string s into a K Periodic string. A character can only be swapped if its present in arr. The code takes the follwoing inputs:
  - N: size of string
  - M: size of available to swap chars (can use infinite times)
  - K: no. of chars
  - string s
  - available chars
