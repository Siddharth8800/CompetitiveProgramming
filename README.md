## K-Periodic (Time Complexity O(n + k x 26) = O(n)) (Space: O(k x 26))
(Every group of all K characters should be equal: abcabcabc, heer k = 3)
Given a string s, we've to find the minimum number of swaps required to convert the string s into a K Periodic string. A character can only be swapped if it's present in arr. The code takes the following inputs:
  - N: size of string
  - M: size of available to swap chars (can use infinite times)
  - K: no. of chars
  - string s
  - available chars

## Weighted Job Scheduling (Time: O(nlogn)) (Space: O(n))
The time complexity of this code is optimized using Binary search to find the non-conflicting job `nc`. It can now fit under constraints 1 <= N <= 10<sup>6</sup>.
Takes the following inputs:
  - N: number of jobs
  - In a loop: start time, end time and profit

## Minimum Platforms (Greedy) (Time: O(nlogn)) (Space: O(1))
Finds a minimum number of platforms required to accommodate all the trains. This is a greedy approach where we sort arrival and departure time arrays, and compare them to increment or decrement the platforms required.
Takes the following input:
  - N: Number of trains
  - In a loop: arrival time and departure time of current train.
